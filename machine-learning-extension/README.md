# Getting Started with the extension

Extensions add functionality and UI to the itwin-viewer.

## Quickstart

1. npm install
2. npm run watch

## Description

On build, extensions create a lib folder named "imjs_extensions/<extension_name>" that our itwin-viewer uses if registered in the itwin app. This sample provides a way to add buttons to the itwin-viewer.
